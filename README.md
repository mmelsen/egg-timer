# Egg timer in react

Create an egg timer using React (and Redux, if needed). This is an overview of the features, devided over some sprints. Using a TDD cycle is allowed but not mandatory.

## Sprint 1
- Hard cooked egg.
  - Count down from `8:00` minutes to `0:00`.
  - Triggered by clicking on a button.
- Make the text `0:00` blink once the egg is cooked.

## Sprint 2

- Soft cooked egg.
  - Add a new option to count down from `4:00` minutes to `0:00`.
- Restart the timer.
